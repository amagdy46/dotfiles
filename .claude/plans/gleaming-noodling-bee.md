# LifeOS Personalization Plan for 2026 Goals

## Overview
Transform the fresh LifeOS template into a personalized life management system aligned with your 2026 goals:
1. **Weight Loss**: 94kg → 80-84kg with good muscle mass
2. **Senior Engineer Growth**: Master databases, networking, problem-solving via TeachYourselfCS
3. **Second Income**: Establish freelancing or stock investing income stream

**Primary Goal**: Get organized & reduce overwhelm through daily tracking and regular reviews

---

## Phase 1: Cleanup - Remove Sample Data

Remove example content that doesn't apply to your situation.

### 1.1 Delete 2023 Sample Periodic Notes
**Delete entire folder**: `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/0. PeriodicNotes/2023/`
- Contains 17+ sample files from 2023 (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly notes)
- Rationale: Sample data clutters the vault and isn't relevant to your 2026 journey

### 1.2 Delete Example Projects
**Delete folders**:
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/1. Projects/parenting-first-birthday-banquet/`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/1. Projects/personal-brand-wot-sharing-meeting/`

**Keep**:
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/1. Projects/README.md`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/1. Projects/Template.md`

Rationale: Example projects are parenting-related (you have no kids) and not applicable

### 1.3 Delete Non-Applicable Areas
**Delete folders**:
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/parenting/`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/parental-relationship/`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/personal-brand/`

**Keep**:
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/README.md`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/Template.md`
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/Work/` (will modify)
- `/home/pokerface/Documents/Obsidian Vault/2. Areas/marriage-relationship/` (will modify)

Rationale: No kids, personal brand not a current focus

### 1.4 Optional Cleanup
**User decides**: Keep or delete sample captures in `-1. Capture/`:
- `Advice for ambitious 19 year olds.md`
- `Predicting The Future.md`
- `Quality software deserves your hard‑earned cash.md`
